# Framework Audit Log

This log captures evidence-based successes and failures for changes to the ai-agents-workflow framework. It exists to improve speed (time-to-working result) and accuracy (first-pass success) without weakening the framework.

## Improvement Gate (Required)
Before recommending or implementing any framework/governance change, answer the gate question and record it with the proposal:

"Does this ensure that the suggested changes will improve and enhance the existing ai-agents-workflow and NOT detract and diminish its effectiveness and quality?"

Acceptable answer (required): "Yes, it will improve the workflow without weakening it."

If the answer is not the exact required statement, the change must be rejected or deferred.

## Baseline (Speed + Accuracy)
Baseline sample: the last 5 framework/governance changes with ledger start timestamps and commit timestamps (Clarification Gate integration, Reasoning Skills layer, validator, housekeeping fast-path rule, workflow audit loop).

Speed metric:
- Measurement: minutes from ledger entry timestamp to commit timestamp.
- Baseline (median): 4.4 minutes (range: 1.1 to 10.9, n=5).

Accuracy metric:
- Measurement: fix-loop count per change and first-pass success rate.
- Baseline: 0 fix-loops per change; first-pass success rate 100% (5/5). Based on no recorded fix loops for the sample.

## Audit Entries
- (Add newest entries at the top.)

Date: 2025-12-26
Change implemented: Updated onboarding/navigation docs (HUMAN_START_HERE.md, docs/humans/concepts-map.md, docs/wiki/index.md) and stack profile/README_SPEC to align the Context-Engineering Framework with the UI Pattern Registry concept; captured workflow snapshot `rev_001_current`.
Outcome (success/failure/mixed): success
Speed result (time-to-working result): Not measured (no prior baseline for this repo).
Accuracy result (first-pass success or fix-loop count): First-pass success; no fix loops.
Notes (what worked / what failed): Navigation now points to registry assets, stack profile matches Node tooling, and README governance is tied to README_SPEC. Snapshot captured for audit trail.

Baseline (current speed + accuracy): Not established for this repo; follow existing framework baseline.
Expected improvement: Faster routing to correct docs with fewer clarification loops.
Pass/Fail criteria: Human entry docs reference registry assets; stack profile matches tooling; README derived from README_SPEC; workflow snapshot produced.
Confidence (low/medium/high): medium
Improvement Gate:
- Q: Does this ensure that the suggested changes will improve and enhance the existing ai-agents-workflow and NOT detract and diminish its effectiveness and quality?
