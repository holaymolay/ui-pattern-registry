# UI Pattern Registry Concept

This Concept defines the machine-readable registry of structural UI patterns governed by Spec `999bd713-5142-49b2-92d9-f22b1ceea0f4`.
It covers the pattern schema, starter pattern set, validation tooling, and documentation needed to keep LLM-driven UI generation within an explicit structural vocabulary.
