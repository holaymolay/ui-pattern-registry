title: CEF UI Pattern Registry
audience:
  - LLM and agent developers
  - Design system and renderer maintainers
version: v0.1.0
spec_id: 999bd713-5142-49b2-92d9-f22b1ceea0f4
summary: Machine-readable registry of allowable UI patterns for LLM-driven front-end systems, governed by the CERES.
sections:
  - heading: Purpose
    bullets:
      - Finite vocabulary of structural UI patterns so agents select allowed layouts instead of inventing them.
      - Renderer-agnostic definitions with explicit roles, constraints, and composability rules.
      - Non-goals: styling, components, prompts, or framework coupling.
  - heading: What's Inside
    bullets:
      - Pattern schema at `schemas/pattern.schema.json`.
      - Starter patterns in `patterns/layouts`, `patterns/compositions`, `patterns/interactions`.
      - Validation tooling in `scripts/validate-patterns.js` plus tests and CI workflow.
      - Project docs in `docs/` covering purpose, pattern definition, usage model, and versioning.
  - heading: Starter Pattern Set
    bullets:
      - Layouts: `layout_hero_stack`, `layout_split_pane`.
      - Compositions: `composition_card_group`, `composition_form_cluster`.
      - Interaction: `interaction_primary_cta_flow`.
  - heading: Usage
    bullets:
      - Install dependencies with `npm install` (or `npm ci`).
      - Validate registry definitions via `npm run validate`.
      - Run tests via `npm test` (includes validation and fixtures).
      - CI runs lint, validation, and tests on push/PR (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).
  - heading: Governance
    bullets:
      - Governed by the CERES (`AGENTS.md`) with Concept `ui-pattern-registry` and Spec `999bd713-5142-49b2-92d9-f22b1ceea0f4`.
      - Stack profile: `docs/stacks/ui-pattern-registry.md`.
      - README generated from this spec; do not edit `README.md` directly.
  - heading: Versioning
    bullets:
      - Repository and package version `0.1.0`; tag releases as `v0.1.0`, `v0.1.1`, etc.
      - Patterns carry their own `version` and `status`; schema version recorded as `schema_version` in each file.
