## Current Focus
- UI Pattern Registry v0.1.0 setup complete (Spec 999bd713-5142-49b2-92d9-f22b1ceea0f4); no open tasks beyond future feature work.

## State Snapshot
- Concept: `ui-pattern-registry` (manifest at concepts/ui-pattern-registry/manifest.yaml); Stack: docs/stacks/ui-pattern-registry.md.
- Schema: schemas/pattern.schema.json (schema_version 0.1.0); Starter patterns: layout_hero_stack, layout_split_pane, composition_card_group, composition_form_cluster, interaction_primary_cta_flow.
- Tooling: npm (package.json v0.1.0), validation script scripts/validate-patterns.js, tests/pattern-validation.test.js, CI at .github/workflows/ci.yml, ESLint via eslint.config.js.
- Docs: docs/purpose.md, docs/what-is-a-pattern.md, docs/usage-model.md, docs/versioning.md, README_SPEC.yaml → README.md; navigation refreshed (HUMAN_START_HERE.md, docs/humans/concepts-map.md, docs/wiki/index.md).
- Workflow snapshot created: ai_workflow_revisions/rev_001_current.
- Remote: https://github.com/holaymolay/ui-pattern-registry (main) with tag v0.1.0 pushed.

## Recent Progress
- Applied governance scaffold (bootstrap script, README governance artifacts, concept manifest) and aligned stack profile for registry tooling.
- Authored JSON Schema for patterns plus starter layout/composition/interaction definitions; added validation script with duplicate detection, fixtures, tests, and CI workflow.
- Documented purpose, pattern definition rules, usage model, and versioning; refreshed README from README_SPEC and navigation/human entrypoints.
- Ran `npm run lint`, `npm run validate`, and `npm test` successfully.

## Next Steps
- Expand catalog with additional patterns as requirements surface (e.g., list/detail flows, navigation shells).
- Add consumer-facing examples for renderer adapters that map pattern roles to components.
- Define review checklist for pattern submissions and automate schema/duplicate checks in consuming repos.

## Pending Items
- None.
